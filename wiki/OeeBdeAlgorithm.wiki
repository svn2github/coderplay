 * All validations can be performed using SQLite queries.

=Sum-up Algorithm=

==Terminology==
 * *Primary entries*:
 Entries that can trigger or terminate the two primary Sum-ups (Preparation and Production), including _MR_, _Prod_, _@97_, and _Maintenance_ entries.


==Algorithm==
 * Select only the rows that contain a primary entry
  * Perform the two primary Sum-ups using the selected rows
   * Ensure Job ID does not change for a Job Sequence
   * Select all non-zero Job ID from source file
    * Ensure every non-zero Job ID has at least one Job Sequence
   * Issue any necessary warnings.
  * Perform the Maintenance Sum-up
   * Issue any necessary warnings.
 * Process entire source file line by line
  * Perform any minor Sum-ups except Maintenance
   * If the line contains a primary entry
    * The minor Sum-ups are terminated
   * If the line does not contain a primary entry
    * The minor Sum-ups are processed by their own rules
   * Issue any necessary warnings
