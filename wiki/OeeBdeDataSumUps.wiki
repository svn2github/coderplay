Rules for sum-up the entries in input files.

==Sum-up Rules==
  * The Sum-up process has two primary categories, *Preparation* and *Production*, defined by following rules:
   * *Preparation*
    * A Preparation Sum-up is triggered by a _MR_ entry when the process is not currently performing a Preparation Sum-up. Otherwise, the _MR_ entry is ignored.
    * A Preparation Sum-up is terminated by a significant _Prod_ entry  or any _Job End_ entry (and _Maintenance_ entry, see [OeeBdeDataSumUps#Possible_Additional_Rules]).
    * The duration of Preparation is calculated as the time difference between the entry that triggers the Sum-up and the entry that terminates the Sum-up. The Impression count is calculated similarly using ImpressionTotal.
    * A significant Preparation Sum-up must have duration longer than 5 minutes and Impression count greater than 20.
    * Only significant Preparation Sum-up is reported in the final output.
   * *Production*
    * A Production Sum-up is triggered by a _Prod_ entry when the process is not currently performing a Production Sum-up. Otherwise, the _Prod_ entry is ignored.
    * A Production Sum-up is terminated by a significant _MR_ entry or any _Job End_ entry (and _Maintenance_ entry, see [OeeBdeDataSumUps#Possible_Additional_Rules]).
    * The duration of Production is calculated as the time difference between the entry that triggers the Sum-up and the entry that terminates the Sum-up. The Impression count is calculated similarly using ImpressionTotal.
    * A significant Production Sum-up must have duration longer than 5 minutes and Impression count greater than 20.
    * Only significant Production Sum-up is reported in the final output.
   * A *Job Sequence* is defined by one Preparation Sum-up followed by one Production Sum-up. A warning is issued if either Preparation or Production Sum-up is not significant.
   * *Job ID* cannot change during a Job Sequence. However, multiple Job Sequences can share the same Job ID.
   * A non-zero Job ID must have at least one Job Sequence.
   * A significant _MR_ entry is a _MR_ entry that triggers a significant Preparation Sum-up. Similarly, a significant _Prod_ entry is a _Prod_ entry that triggers a significant Production Sum-up.

  * The Sum-up process has several minor categories, *W-up*, *Process* and *Maintenance*, defined by following rules:
   * *W-up*
    * A W-up Sum-up is triggered by a _W-up_ entry when the process is not currently performing a W-up Sum-up.
    * Status code of a _W-up_ entry is always accumulated whenever the Sum-up process reads the entry. 
    * A W-up Sum-up is terminated if the value of the accumulation is zero. Otherwise, it proceeds further.
    * The _W-up_ Sum-up is always terminated by any _MR_, _Prod_, _Job End_ or _Maintenance_ entries. If the accumulation is not zero when it is terminated, the accumulation is reset to zero and a warning is issued.
   * *Process*
    * A Process Sum-up is triggered by a _Process_ entry.
    * A Process Sum-up is terminated by any _MR_, _Prod_, _Job End_ or _Maintenance_(?) entries.
   * *Maintenance*
    * A Maintenance Sum-up is triggered by a _Maintenance_ entry.
    * A Maintenance Sum-up is terminated by any _MR_, _Prod_, _Job End_ entries (In theory, only _MR_ can possibly follow a Maintenance Sum-up and terminate it? Otherwise, we may want issue a warning.) 

==Possible Additional Rules==
  * A _Maintenance_ terminates both Preparation and Production Sum-ups. A warning message is issued if it happens.
  * Any _Prod_ or _Job End_ terminates a Maintenance Sum-up. A warning message is issued if it happens.
  * A warning message is issued if any _W-up_ entries is found in during a Production Sum-up.
