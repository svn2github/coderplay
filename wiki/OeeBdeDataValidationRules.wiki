#Data validation rules for raw [OeeBdeFile bde files].

 * Term Definitions
  * *MR entry* - can be either @95 or MR
  * *Prod entry* - Prod
  * *Job End entry* - @97
  * *non-blank job* - a job that has non-zero job ID

 * Basic Rules
  # Process only row with REC020 as its first column.
  # The records should be processed line by line following the increasing order of timestamp.
  # Timestamp column must increase monotonically.
  # Maximum Timestamp must not be in the future.
  # Minimum Timestamp must not be earlier than the maximum Timestamp in reporting database.
  # ImpressionTotal Column must increase monotonically.
  # ImpressionTotal must be larger than the last record in reporting database.

 * Advanced Rules
  # The validation process has three primary status, *preparation*, *production* and *finishing*.
   * A status is a sum up of individual entries of the input data. It is triggered and ended by certain entries from the input data.
  # A non-blank job sequence must undergo the three primary status, *preparation*, *production* and *finishing* for at least once.
  # A *preparation* status begins when processing a *MR entry* and the process is NOT in a prepration status. Once in *preparation* status, it lasts till it is terminated. If another *MR entry* is found during a preparation status, it is ignored.
  # A *preparation* status is terminated when a *production* or *finishing* status begins.
  # A *production* status begins when processing a *Prod entry* and the process is NOT in a production status. Once a production begins, it lasts till it is terminated. If another *Prod entry* is found during a production status, it is ignored.
  # A *production* status is terminated when a valid *preparation* begins or encounters an *end*.
  # The duration of *preparation* or *production* is calculated as the time difference between its first entry and the entry where it is terminated.
  # A valid *preparation* or *production* must last for at least 5 minutes and cost 20 ImpressionTotal.
  # *prepare* and *production* must be paired.
