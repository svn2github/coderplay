#Data validation rules for raw [OeeBdeFile bde files].

 ==Terminology==
  * _MR_ entry - can be either @95 or any ActivityCode that belongs to MR category
  * _Prod_ entry - any ActivityCode that belongs to Prod category
  * _Job End_ entry - @97
  * _W-up_ entry - any ActivityCode that belongs to W-up category
  * _Process_ entry - 4068
  * _Maintenance_ entry - 9005 and 9007


 ==Basic Rules==
  # RecordID must exist in its master table in reporting database.
  # EquipmentID must exist in its master table in reporting database.
  # ActivityCode must exist in its master table in reporting database.
  # Only rows with RecordID, REC020, as its first column are significant and processed.
  # First significant row must have a non-zero Job ID.
  # EquipmentID must remain the same for all significant rows in a file.
  # TimeStamp column must increase monotonically.
  # Maximum TimeStamp must not be in the future.
  # Minimum TimeStamp must not be earlier than the maximum TimeStamp in reporting database.
  # ImpressionTotal column must increase monotonically.
  # ImpressionTotal must be larger than the last record in reporting database.
  # ImpressionTotal must in the range of 1 million to 999 million.
  # File must contain at least one @95.
  # A file must contain at least 500 significant rows.
  # All ActivityCode is significant except @17.
  # The first significant code of the significant rows must belong to a _MR_ entry.
  # The files are processed line by line following the increasing order of TimeStamp.


 ==Sum-up Rules==
  # The Sum-up process has two primary categories, *Preparation* and *Production*, defined by following rules:
   * *Preparation*
    * A Preparation Sum-up is triggered by a _MR_ entry when the process is not currently performing a Preparation Sum-up. Otherwise, the _MR_ entry is ignored.
    * A Preparation Sum-up is terminated by a significant _Prod_ entry  or any _Job End_ entry.
    * The duration of Preparation is calculated as the time difference between the entry that triggers the Sum-up and the entry that terminates the Sum-up. The Impression count is calculated similarly using ImpressionTotal.
    * A significant Preparation Sum-up must have duration longer than 5 minutes and Impression count greater than 20.
   * *Production*
    * A Production Sum-up is triggered by a _Prod_ entry when the process is not currently performing a Production Sum-up. Otherwise, the _Prod_ entry is ignored.
    * A Production Sum-up is terminated by a significant _MR_ entry or any _Job End_ entry.
    * The duration of Production is calculated as the time difference between the entry that triggers the Sum-up and the entry that terminates the Sum-up. The Impression count is calculated similarly using ImpressionTotal.
    * A significant Production Sum-up must have duration longer than 5 minutes and Impression count greater than 20.
   * A *Job Sequence* is defined by one _Preparation_ Sum-up followed by one _Production_ Sum-up.
   * *Job ID* cannot change during a Job Sequence. However, multiple Job Sequences can share the same Job ID.
   * A significant _MR_ entry is a _MR_ entry that triggers a Significant Preparation Sum-up. Similarly, a significant _Prod_ entry is a _Prod_ entry that triggers a Significant Production Sum-up.
  # The Sum-up process has several minor categories, *W-up*, *Process*, *Maintenance-H* and *Maintenance-I*, defined by following rules:
   * *W-up*
    * A W-up Sum-up is triggered by a _W-up_ entry when the process is not currently performing a W-up Sum-up.
    * Status code of a _W-up_ entry is always accumulated whenever the Sum-up process reads the entry. 
    * A W-up Sum-up is terminated if the value of the accumulation is zero. Otherwise, it proceeds further.
    * The _W-up_ Sum-up is always terminated by any _MR_, _Prod_, _Job End_ or _Maintenance_ entries. If the accumulation is not zero when it is terminated, the accumulation is reset to zero and a warning is issued.
   * *Process*
    * A Process Sum-up is triggered by a _Process_ entry.
    * A Process Sum-up is terminated by any _MR_, _Prod_, _Job End_ or _Maintenance_(?) entries.
