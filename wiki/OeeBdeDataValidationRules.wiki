#Data validation rules for raw [OeeBdeFile bde files].

 ==Terminology==
  * *{{{MR}}}* - can be either @95 or MR
  * *{{{Prod}}}* - Prod
  * *{{{Job End}}}* - @97
  * *non-blank job* - a job that has non-zero job ID

 ==Basic Rules==
  # Only rows with REC020 as its first column are processed.
  # The records should be processed line by line following the increasing order of timestamp.
  # Timestamp column must increase monotonically.
  # Maximum Timestamp must not be in the future.
  # Minimum Timestamp must not be earlier than the maximum Timestamp in reporting database.
  # ImpressionTotal Column must increase monotonically.
  # ImpressionTotal must be larger than the last record in reporting database.

 ==Advanced Rules==
  # The validation process has two primary Sum-ups, *preparation* and *production*.
   * *preparation*
    * A preparation Sum-up is triggered by a `MR` entry when the process is NOT currently performing a preparation Sum-up. Otherwise, the {{{MR}}} entry is ignored.
    * A preparation Sum-up is terminated by a significant {{{Prod}}} entry  or any {{{Job End}}} entry.
   * *production*
    * A production Sum-up is triggered by a {{{Prod}}} entry when the process is NOT currently performing a production Sum-up. Otherwise, the {{{Prod}}} entry is ignored.
    * A production Sum-up is terminated by a significant {{{MR}}} entry or any {{{Job End}}} entry.
  # For a non-blank job sequence, the two primary Sum-ups must be paired with {{{preparation}}} followed by {{{production}}}.
  # A non-blank job sequence must have of the two primary Sum-ups for at least once.
  # The duration of preparation and production is calculated as the time difference between the entry that triggers the Sum-up and the entry that terminates the Sum-up. The Impression count is calculated similarly using ImpressionTotal.
  # A significant preparation or production Sum-up must has duration longer than 5 minutes and Impression Count greater than 20.
  # A significant MR entry is a MR entry that triggers a Significant preparation Sum-ups. Similarly, a significant Prod entry is a Prod entry that triggers a Significant production Sum-ups.
