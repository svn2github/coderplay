#Data validation rules for raw [OeeBdeFile bde files].

 ==Terminology==
  * _MR_ - can be either @95 or MR
  * _Prod_ - Prod
  * _Job End_ - @97
  * _non-blank job_ - a job that has non-zero job ID

 ==Basic Rules==
  # Only rows with REC020 as its first column are processed.
  # The records should be processed line by line following the increasing order of timestamp.
  # Timestamp column must increase monotonically.
  # Maximum Timestamp must not be in the future.
  # Minimum Timestamp must not be earlier than the maximum Timestamp in reporting database.
  # ImpressionTotal Column must increase monotonically.
  # ImpressionTotal must be larger than the last record in reporting database.

 ==Advanced Rules==
  # The validation process has two primary Sum-ups, *Preparation* and *Production*.
   * *Preparation*
    * A Preparation Sum-up is triggered by a _MR_ entry when the process is NOT currently performing a Preparation Sum-up. Otherwise, the _MR_ entry is ignored.
    * A Preparation Sum-up is terminated by a significant _Prod_ entry  or any _Job End_ entry.
   * *Production*
    * A Production Sum-up is triggered by a _Prod_ entry when the process is NOT currently performing a Production Sum-up. Otherwise, the _Prod_ entry is ignored.
    * A Production Sum-up is terminated by a significant _MR_ entry or any _Job End_ entry.
  # For a _non-blank job_ sequence, the two primary Sum-ups must be paired with _Preparation_ followed by _Production_.
  # A _non-blank job_ sequence must have of the two primary Sum-ups for at least once.
  # The duration of Preparation and Production is calculated as the time difference between the entry that triggers the Sum-up and the entry that terminates the Sum-up. The Impression count is calculated similarly using ImpressionTotal.
  # A significant Preparation or Production Sum-up must has duration longer than 5 minutes and Impression Count greater than 20.
  # A significant MR entry is a MR entry that triggers a Significant Preparation Sum-ups. Similarly, a significant Prod entry is a Prod entry that triggers a Significant Production Sum-ups.
