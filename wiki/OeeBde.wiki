OEE Reporting Tools.

= Introduction =

The purpose of this project is to have a GUI-driven program to process raw [OeeBdeFile bde] data. A report is generated for the processed data. The report is further used by other programs for additional analysis, which is out of the scope of this project. 

== Functionalities ==
 * Read a ASCII text based [OeeBdeFile *.bde file].
 * Reconcile contents of the file and temporarily store them as SQLite Database format.
 * Validate the data using a set of [OeeBdeDataValidationRules validation rules].
 * Perform sum-ups with a set of [OeeBdeDataSumUps sum-up rules] based on the validated data.
 * Generate helpful messages for any errors found in above two steps. The messages should be useful hints for users to correct the source [OeeBdeFile bde file].
 * An Activity Sum-up Report is generated if all above steps succeed.
 * The data are stored in the main database for future references.
 * The program must have a GUI for easy access.
 * The program should be package as a stand-alone executable file (Windows format).

== Development Tools ==
 * Python
 * Tkinter
 * PySqlite
 * Py2exe(?)
