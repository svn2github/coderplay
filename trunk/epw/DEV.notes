1. yyerror has to be explicitly provided by the user and declared properly in
   a header file.
2. Somehow, strncpy keeps getting reported as memory leaks. No idea why.
3. To use both ";" and "\n" as the punctuator, I have to return a Single EOL
   for the combo and ";"{WHITESPACE}"\n"
4. Once a new operator is added. We need to define its precedence and 
   associative. Otherwise, Bison may report many conflicts.
5. Define a struct in one file and use in in multiple source files can have the
   following two approaches. 
   * Put the struct definition in a header file with ifndef guard and include
     the header file in multiple source files.
   * Use a simple forward declaration such as struct a; is enough if all we need
     in another file is using a pointer to the struct.
6. It is perfectly OK to free a void pointer and it frees it correctly no matter
   what type of data the pointer actually points to. In fact, the free function
   ever sees is a void pointer.
7. Negative numbers must be treated using UMINUS.
