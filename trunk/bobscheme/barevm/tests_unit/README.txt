Bob barevm's unit tests go here. Write each logical set of unit tests in a file
of its own named unittest_<name>.cpp

The gtest (googletest) unit testing library is used for the tests.
gtest 1.5.0 is bundled as a "fused" version in directory "gtest/".

By default, gtest's own test runner is used, so the barevm library is linked
with gtest_main.
